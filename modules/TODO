## Modules to work on
[] PollsManager -- making, reading, ending polls programatically
[] !help for commands generated from docstring (twitchio contrib)
[] ChannelPoint redemptions management so that I can clear/refund from chat
[] and some general bans/timeouts/raids/ -- auto generate raid list; who raided recently, who we've raided recently
[] overlays --- aquafunk knows I don't but we do need that lighter overlay (like !link but on steroids)
[] greetings -- profile pics where applicable, twitch clips auto play on user seen
[] addtobox (probably in girlwithbox)
